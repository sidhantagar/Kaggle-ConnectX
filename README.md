# Kaggle-ConnectX
In this machine learning project from kaggle, we are required to make an agent that plays the game of ConnectX using reinforcement learning. The agent takes in various parametres such as the size of the board, the mark assigned to the agent, the current configuration of the board and returns a number of the column that it thinks is the best move for the game. Each agent is then evaluated by playing with other agents and then assigned a skill level.

## This repository contains one agent:

1. In the first agent I have implemented a simple minimax algorithm with a custom heuristic function and one step look-ahead. This Folder contains the agent as as a py file and a jupyter notebook with a detailed walkthrough of the intutions behind the making of the agent and the custom heuristic function. (The skill of the agent is 1034.7 at the time of writing). You can also visit "https://www.kaggle.com/sidagar/getting-1000-score-using-only-minimax"  to view the explanation notebook over kaggle.
